Will be fixed soon.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n======\r\n\r\n1. Get Python, get mkvtoolnix, get mkvfps.exe from [here](http://konousa.ru/mkvfps.exe), get x264 8-bit version\r\n2. Clone repo\r\n3. Put mkvtoolnix exes to mkvtoolnix subfolder\r\n4. Put x264.exe near haihai.py\r\n5. Put some Hi10P files into 10bit subfolder\r\n6. Run haihai.py\r\n\r\nFuck this, I want binaries!\r\n======\r\n\r\nNo problem, get it [here](http://konousa.ru/10to8.7z).\r\n\r\n1. Put videos into 10bit folder (create it)\r\n2. Run haihai.exe and you're good\r\n\r\nLinux?\r\n======\r\n\r\nSoon. For now you can use Wine — it works.\r\n\r\nAdvanced\r\n======\r\n\r\nYou can put Hi10P in subfolders and script will preserve them. That's what it was created for :)\r\n\r\nGui?\r\n======\r\n\r\nNo. This is batch processing script made to be as autonomous as possible (run and forget). Gui is not needed.\r\n\r\nOptions\r\n======\r\n\r\nYou can play with x264 settings to produce different quality files\r\n\r\nInstall py2exe for python and generate haihai.exe for use w/o Python via setup.py py2exe\r\n\r\nWhat's with the name?\r\n======\r\n\r\nRoughly Japanese “yesyes”, comes from **Hi**10P + **Hi**P.","note":"Don't delete this file!
